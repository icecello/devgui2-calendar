 * AbstractAction that uses the method's defined action. All properties related
 * to an AbstractAction are derived from the associated ResourceBundle, which
 * has to contain specific entries for the actions that are requested.
 * 
 * An entry in the ResourceBundle file should follow this template:
 * <i>full classname</i>.<i>method name</i>.<i>property</i>
 * where property refers to one of the following:
 * text				text to display as name for the associated component
 * tooltip			hovering popup description
 * desc				something else ??
 * 
 * Note: only the property <i>text</i> is actually supported in this current version of
 * ActionManager
